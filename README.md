### Getting started
Remember: one of the goals in this class is to become proficient in using a text editor, navigating a linux file system with unix commands, and running programs from a command line. I'd like you to do this assignment on cslab, and the easiest way to get all the files from here up to your account on cslab is to use git. 

1. Create an account on GitHub if you don't already have one: https://github.com/signup
2. Log into cslab.
3. Type the following command to "clone" this respository to your home directory on cslab.

### Part 1: Bash scripting




### Part 2: Try it in Python



### Part 3: HTML


### Part 4: XML


### Part 5: Combining Python with bash
