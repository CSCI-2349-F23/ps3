### Getting started
Remember: one of the goals in this class is to become proficient in using a text editor, navigating a linux file system with unix commands, and running programs from a command line. I'd like you to do this assignment on cslab, and the easiest way to get all the files from here up to your account on cslab is to use git. 

1. Create an account on GitHub if you don't already have one: https://github.com/signup
2. Log into cslab.
3. Type the following command to "clone" this respository to your home directory on cslab.

```
git clone https://github.com/CSCI-2349-F23/ps3.git
```

4. Type `ls` and you'll see that you now have a directory in your home directory called `ps3`.

(For future problem sets, you'll just put a different URL after `git clone`. When viewing the repo in your web browser, click the green `Code` button in the upper right corner. This will display the URL, which you can copy and paste.)

5. If you `ls ps3`, you'll see that there are a few files and a `data` directory. In that directory are four subdirectories: `txt`, `csv`, `html`, and `xml`, each of which has a few files. You'll be using these files as input in the different parts of this problem set.

### Part 1: Bash scripting

1. Write a single line in unix that will do the following for the file `data/csv/movies.csv`: extract the 1st, 2nd, and 8th fields, upcase everything, pick out the lines that contain the phrase "OF THE", then sort alphabetically. You should have XX lines, where the first 5 and last 5 lines are as shown below.

2. Write a single line in unix to count in each of the files in the `csv` directory the number of 


### Part 2: Try it in Python



### Part 3: HTML


### Part 4: XML


### Part 5: Combining Python with bash
